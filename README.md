# Elfin Library

This repo serves protein data produced by [elfin-data](https://github.com/joy13975/elfin-data)'s data processing. 

```xdb.json```: a dictionary data structure containing transformation data between modules and collision radii data.

```library.blend```: a Blender library file used by [elfin-ui](https://github.com/joy13975/elfin-ui) to display modules in Blender.

The raw PDB atomic models over at [elfin-data](https://github.com/joy13975/elfin-data) are awaiting publication, that's why they're kept private.
